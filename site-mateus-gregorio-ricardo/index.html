    THE PHANTOM MENACE <br>
    Turmoil has engulfed the <br>
    Galactic Republic. The taxation <br>
    of trade routes to outlying star <br>
    systems is in dispute. <br>
    <br>

    with a blockade of deadly <br>
    battleships, the greedy Trade <br>
    Federation has stopped all <br>
    shipping to the small planet <br>
    of Naboo. <br>
    <br>
    While the Congress of the <br>
    Republic endlessly debates <br>
    this alarming chain of events, <br>
    the Supreme Chancellor has <br>
    secretly dispatched two Jedi <br>
    Knights, the guardians of <br>
    peace and justice in the <br>
    galaxy, to settle the conflict....
